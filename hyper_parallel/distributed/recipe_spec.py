"""recipe_spec: recipe input contract and placement DSL for the dual-mode DTensor strategy.

Contains the user-visible plan/spec data model (05 §3.1/§3.2 canonical):
- ``MeshAxisName``: mesh dimension name enum (canonical definition, imported and reused by later docs such as 06);
- ``NamedPlacement``: alias for ``dict[MeshAxisName, Placement]``;
- ``ModuleShardingSpec``: per-module I/O contract;
- ``PlacementMismatchError``: error for placement declarations inconsistent with DTensor propagation;
- ``resolve_placements`` / ``parse_placement`` / ``parse_named_placement`` / ``_normalize_out_fields``:
  placement utilities;
- the injection DSL (``local_compute`` / ``inner_wrapper`` decorators,
  ``InjectionMeta``, ``require_injection_meta``): the recipe-side input
  contract of the explicit injection mechanism.

The model-level :class:`ShardingPlan` lives in ``distributed/plan.py``; the
semantic-role templates live in ``distributed/_builder/default_templates.py``.

# Injection DSL: template decorators for injected functions (the entry-point
# discipline of the explicit injection mechanism).
#
# Design principle: **an injected function is called exactly once at apply
# time, must declare the mesh family (filled by the framework by name; axes
# that are not active are filled with None), and may use them or not**. Two
# decorators cover all injection channels, each with a single canonical form:
#
# - ``@local_compute``: a regional-compute **factory**,
#   ``fn(mesh, tp_mesh, cp_mesh, ep_mesh, [module], <config keys...>)
#   -> compute_fn`` -- built once at apply time;
# - ``@inner_wrapper``: an inner-forward wrapper, ``fn(target_module, mesh,
#   tp_mesh, cp_mesh, ep_mesh)`` -- returns the replacement forward (in-repo
#   discipline; the forward rewriter installs it) or replaces
#   ``target.forward`` in place and returns None (the external contract).
#
# Hard rules enforced by the decorators (fail-fast at import time): required
# context must be declared in full; context parameters must not have default
# values; injected functions forbid *args/**kwargs. The full design rationale
# is documented in docs/design/ (05 §3.7) — the runtime-layer signature
# validators live in ``distributed/_builder/forward_rewriter.py``.
