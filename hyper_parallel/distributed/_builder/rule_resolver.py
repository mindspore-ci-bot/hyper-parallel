    """Unified override pass, executed before Phase 5 and the D-14 checks.

    Three modes:

    - **merge** (key hits an existing boundary — derived or previously
      inserted): UNSET contract fields (``None``: ``params`` /
      ``in_src`` / ``in_dst`` / ``out_src`` / ``out_dst`` /
      ``out_names``) INHERIT, set ones replace at field granularity —
      **an explicit empty dict {} is a SET value** (explicit "no
      sharding / no contract", 2026-08-05 "unset inherits, written is
      honored"); the
      sentinels ``"auto"``/``"none"`` mean inherit/clear explicitly;
      injection fields
      (``local_compute_fn`` / ``inner_target`` / ``inner_wrapper``
      non-None, ``region_dispatch=False``) always win; internal flags
      (``_ep_size`` / ``_ep_stack`` / ``_needs_cp_attn`` /
      ``_is_terminal``) always inherit — they are
      planner/applier-owned metadata, not user contracts. This is how
      CP/EP compute injection is declared: an injection-fields-only
      spec (``ModuleShardingSpec(local_compute_fn=...)``) inherits the
      whole derived contract;
    - **insert** (exact key misses every boundary): the spec is
      deep-copied and inserted as-is; at least one contract field must
      be declared (an explicit {} counts — the pure I/O-stitch
      boundary) — an override with EVERYTHING unset fails fast
      ("no template/boundary matched"). Sentinels are rejected (nothing
      to inherit/clear). Nesting (ancestor/descendant
      FQNs) is **allowed** since D-14 (05 §13), subject only to the
      param-uniqueness invariant (``_check_param_uniqueness``);
    - **glob keys** (containing ``*``/``?``/``[``): merge-applied to
      every matching boundary (fnmatchcase, ``*`` spans dots); a
      pattern hitting nothing warns loudly. Glob keys never insert.

    Notes:
    - exact keys must exist in the model's ``named_modules`` (typo
      fail-fast; PP scenarios plan each single-part model separately);
    - ``out_src``/``out_dst`` scalar shorthand is normalized;
    - user spec objects are never mutated (merge reads them, insert
      deep-copies them) — plan() can be called repeatedly.
