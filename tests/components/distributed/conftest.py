"""Shared fixtures for ``tests/components/distributed``.

The toy models (``TinyConfig`` / ``TinyLlamaAttention`` /
``TinyLlamaForCausalLM``) and the distributed harness moved to
``tests/ut/dual_mode_dtensor/conftest.py`` in the auto_models reorg.  This
module re-exports the fixtures so the suites under this package keep using
them without a second copy drifting from the canonical one.
